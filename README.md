# EmbeddedSystems
A repository that contains my work in embedded systems

1. [Traffic Light](https://github.com/AhmedKhaled8/TrafficLight-Assembly) : Design a traffic light (red, green) that you can select the toggle time (time to change from red to green and vice-versa) and the time elapsed between each 2 counts e.g. the time between the count 30 and the count 29.
2. [Elevator](https://github.com/AhmedKhaled8/Elevator) : Simulating an elevator using 8051 microcontroller using C. The buliding has 5 floor, including GND, and each floor has an UP and DOWN buttons except for the last and GND floors.
